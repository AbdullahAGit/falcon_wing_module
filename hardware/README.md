# Hardware Files

The designs for the wing module reside here. The module is an evolution of two separate boards on Falcon: the distributed voltage regulators (`servo_regulator`), and the spar load sensing boards (`spar_sensor`). As such, their design files are included in this repository for reference in addition to the actual wing module design files.

## Software Used

All designs were made in KiCad, version 9.0 as of writing.
